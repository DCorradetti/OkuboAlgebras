##Abstract##
The compact 16-dimensional Moufang plane, also known as the Cayley plane, has traditionally been defined through the lens of octonionic geometry. In this study, we present a novel approach, demonstrating
that the Cayley plane can be defined in an equally clean, straightforward and more economic way using two different division and composition algebras: the paraoctonions and the Okubo algebra. The result is quite
surprising since paraoctonions and Okubo algebra possess a weaker algebraic structure than the octonions, since they are non-alternative and do not satisfy the Moufang identities. Intriguingly, the real Okubo
algebra has $\text{SU}\left(3\right)$ as automorphism group, which is a classical Lie group, while octonions and paraoctonions have an exceptional Lie group of type $\text{G}_{2}$. This is remarkable,
given that the projective plane defined over the real Okubo algebra is nevertheless isomorphic and isometric to the octonionic projective plane which is at the very heart of the geometric realisations of
all types of exceptional Lie groups. Despite its historical ties with octonionic geometry, our research underscores the real Okubo algebra as the weakest algebraic structure allowing the definition of the
compact 16-dimensional Moufang plane.
